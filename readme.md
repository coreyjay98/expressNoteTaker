## Project Description

For this project I had to utilise express to create routes for a server and serve data to and from a database file to display notes. I was given HTML and front end javascript and worked to wire up the back end to a simple JSON database file, making sure the correct data was displayed on the corresponding GET requests

### Installation

As this app is ran through node, if you wanted to install it from GitHub you would need to install the express package for node and run the server.js file through the terminal in node, this will give you the rendered HTML in the local host in your browser (If you change the Port number).

Alternatively I have hosted this app through Heroku and so instead of hosting it yourself, you can view the app I have created through this link here !

### Usage

Use of this application is simple as once you open the page on the Heroku site above you can input notes and delete them at your own will, they will be stored so you can retrieve them upon re-entering the site

### Technologies Used

Javascript, Node.js, NPM, Express
